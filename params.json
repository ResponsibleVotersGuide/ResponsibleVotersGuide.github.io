  "body": "# Welcome to the Responsible Voters Guide\r\n\r\nThe responsible voters guide is a new initiative to suggest people make the responsible choice when marking their ballot on or before election day. The difference between this and other WA voters guides is we don't follow any party lines or ideology, nor do we endorse any humans in the races. We have a team of experts in the back room who examine and scrutinize the legal, written policies of initiatives and ballot measures, and so they don't have much time to sit down with each individual candidate. In our opinion, when voting on an initiative you know exactly what you're getting, whether it be a tax increase, a law passing or being repealed, or a refinement of how our local democracy is structured. We find humans to be imprecise, emotional, and subject to be swayed by money.\r\n\r\n## Without further ado...\r\n\r\n**Lets get on with it.**\r\n\r\n### Initiative Measure No. 1433: Vote **NO** to prevent Washington's cost of living from spiraling out of control.\r\n\r\n### Initiative Measure No. 1464: Vote **NO** to prevent sending an additional $660M in taxes every four years to WA politicians' campaigns instead of schools and infrastructure.\r\n\r\n### Initiative Measure No. 1491: Vote **YES** to keep firearms away from extremely dangerous individuals, and a step toward an actual background check\r\n\r\n### Initiative Measure No. 1501: Vote **NO** to prevent meddling with WA's nation-leading Public Records Act to protect a special interest group\r\n\r\n### Initiative Measure No. 732: Vote **YES** to cut our dependence on dinosaur fuels and tax what hurts everyone, especially the poor (climate change and pollution), and reduce one of that nation's highest sales tax.\r\n\r\n### Initiative Measure No. 735: Vote **YOUR CONSCIENCE** because this initiative has no legal ramifications other than killing a bunch of trees to print and mail the initiative to a bunch of federal officials.\r\n\r\nYou can vote YES on this to feel better about voting NO on I-1464.\r\n\r\n### Senate Joint Resolution No. 8210: Vote **YES** to speed up the redistricting of your legislative districts before the holidays distract everyone from the results.\r\n\r\n## Local Initiatives\r\n\r\nWe have included a few of the local issues people have asked us to include from regional elections.\r\n\r\n### King County Charter Amendment No. 1 - Nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorney: Vote **YES**to make one less elected official partisan.\r\n\r\n### King County Charter Amendment No. 2 - Gender-Neutral Language: Vote **YOUR CONSCIENCE** to change \"man/men\" to \"person\".\r\n\r\nThis is mostly a distraction from the larger issues surrounding the king county charger - making the language gender neutral won't fix the wealth distribution, racial and gender inequality, transit access, and housing crisis, among other issues.\r\n\r\n### Sound Transit (A Regional Transit Authority) Proposition No. 1 Light-Rail, Commuter-Rail, and Bus Service Expansion: Vote **APPROVED** to get our share of Federal money, plus reduce commutes even for people that drive cars.\r\n\r\nYes, it's expensive. Yes, we should've done this in the 70s when the federal government would have footed most of the bill. But no, self-driving single-passenger and dozen-passenger buses will not solve this region's need to move tens of thousands of people per hour between our cities, and it won't get any cheaper if we say no and wait more years for another plan - it'll cost the same and we'll see less benefit - we'll end up like LA where they have stations planned to open in the 2060s.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nYou can contribute to this guide if you can bring a thoughtful, reasoned argument in favor or against any of our stated positions. We too, as humans, are fallible and thus made have made an error or omission, or simple didn't do our research enough.
